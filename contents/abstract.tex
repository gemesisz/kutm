\section{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}

If you like to spend your free time playing video games there is a high likelihood that you
experienced one of the biggest problems in the gaming industry: cheating. Cheating ruins the
competitive integrity of video games, and when it is widespread it can even damage the game by
making the players leave the game, causing a dwindling player base. Game developers have
tried numerous ways of fighting cheats, with varying success rates. A more innovative and less
explored way of anti-cheat development involves artificial intelligence. This paper aims to further explore the possibility
and effectiveness of using AI for cheat detection.

The problem covers a wide variety of different platforms and different types of video-games available on the market.
In order to get the best results possible we try solving the problem with a combination of different AI powered techniques, namely DNNs, explainable AI and more.

By implementing, testing, and deploying our AI-driven anti-cheat solution we aim to
demonstrate that AI can be more effective in identifying cheaters than traditional anti-cheating
measures. Our finished system gives game developers a chance to significantly reduce cheating
in their games, and maintain the integrity of competitive gaming.
